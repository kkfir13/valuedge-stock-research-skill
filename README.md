# Buffett Brain 🧠
## Open-source Warren Buffett investing research — original sources, not mythology

**Buffett Brain is an independent, fully self-hostable research project** about Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's investing principles, historic deals, capital allocation, economic moats, mistakes, shareholder letters, and the influence of Benjamin Graham and Charlie Munger.

**Verified baseline:** 60 linked sources, 55 original evidence notes, 8 long-form transaction case studies, and four brief attributed quotations. The primary-source index covers links to official Berkshire shareholder letters for 1977–2024 plus SEC filings, CNBC's licensed meetings archive, and relevant book catalogs. **A linked letter is not a claim its entire contents have been reviewed.** All research can be used without a ValuEdge subscription.

## Run the research website

Requires Python 3 and a browser; no cloud AI, credentials, npm install, paid API or account.

```bash
git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL buffett-brain
cd buffett-brain
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Visit **http://localhost:8000/** and search: `See's Candies`, `GEICO`, `Dexter Shoe`, `Goldman Sachs 2008`, `circle of competence` or `Benjamin Graham`.

### Install the AI skill

[SKILL.md](SKILL.md) is a portable Agent Skills instruction file for Claude Code, Codex, and compatible assistants. It searches the local evidence registry, demands primary-source citations, distinguishes factual history from our commentary, and refuses to fabricate Buffett opinions. It is not an official Buffett persona.

### Offline research commands

```bash
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "GEICO turnaround" --limit 5
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "Dexter Shoe" --kind mistake
python3 scripts/search_knowledge.py "Buffett's statements" --kind statement
python3 scripts/validate_knowledge.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
node --check app.js
```

## GitHub Topics and Google discoverability

When this standalone branch is transferred to a separate public repository called `buffett-brain`, set its description to: *Open-source Warren Buffett & Berkshire Hathaway research: shareholder letters, historical investment decisions, value investing principles, mistakes and a source-linked AI agent skill.*

Recommended GitHub Topics: `buffett-principles`, `warren-buffett`, `buffett`, `value-investing`, `berkshire-hathaway`, `shareholder-letters`, `investment-research`, `ai-skills`, `agent-skills`.

**Staging note:** This is the dedicated `buffett-brain-standalone` branch of the existing ValuEdge stock-research repository. It has not yet been created as its own GitHub repository; the current connection cannot create repositories or change their About/Topics metadata. No search ranking or Google indexing is promised.
